        <p>Years ago, I used to create games on Unity, which honed my C# skills as well as gave me a foundation in object-oriented programming</p>
        <p>I'm also a huge fan of Pokemon. I never quite finished building a full Pokemon game, but please try out the demo below</p>
        <p>Walk in the tall grass for a random encounter. Use the arrow keys to move, and Z to select</p>

        <p>Nowadays, I'm much more involved with Data as a research assistant and as a hobby</p>
        <p>The libraries I work with are Keras, Tensorflow, Numpy, Pandas, OpenCV, etc.</p>
        <p>The projects I work on as part of my research position are related to computer vision, namely, classification and "continuous" prediction
        from images, as well as some NLP, mostly using Transformers, CNN's, Transfer learning with state-of-the-art models, MLP's, etc.</p>
        <p>The projects I work on as a hobby mostly consist of time series prediction, so LSTM's are an example of a network I use</p>
        <p>Also, since the GPT craze, working with its API on personal projects is a big pleasure</p>
        <p>I'm writing all this as I cannot share research projects (NDA), as well as work-related projects (NDA)<br>
        and for my personal projects - ATM I'm not sharing my models ;)</p>
        <p>I am looking for a place to grow, to learn, and to contribute. Please check out my CV below</p>
