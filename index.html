        <p>Years ago, I used to create games on Unity, which honed my C# skills as well as gave me a foundation in object-oriented programming</p>
        <p>I'm also a huge fan of Pokemon. I never quite finished building a full Pokemon game, but please try out the demo below</p>
        <p>Walk in the tall grass for a random encounter (Battle). Use the arrow keys to move, and Z to select</p>

        <p>Nowadays, I'm much more involved with Data as a research assistant and as a hobby</p>
        <p>The libraries I work with are Keras, Tensorflow, Numpy, Pandas, OpenCV, etc.</p>
        <p>The projects I work on as part of my research position are related to computer vision, namely, classification and "continuous"<br> prediction
        from images, as well as some NLP, mostly using Transformers, CNN's, Transfer learning with state-of-the-art models, MLP's, etc.</p>
        <p>The projects I work on as a hobby mostly consist of time series prediction, so LSTM's are an example of a network I use</p>
        <p>Also, since the GPT craze, working with its API on personal projects is a big pleasure</p>
        <p>I'm writing all this as I cannot share research projects (NDA), as well as work-related projects (NDA)<br>
        and for my personal projects - I'd like to share some below, though the bulk of them is private for now ;)</p>
